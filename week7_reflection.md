#  Week 7 Reflection 
 
    The assignment for Week 7 focused on using superclasses. We had to look at two different files and identify where the code was being repeated. To eliminate this repetition, we created a superclass to hold the shared parts and then used subclasses for the specific details. This helped make the code cleaner and easier to manage.The first superclass I created was for Vehicles. The superclass stores all the common features that every vehicle shares. To prevent repetition, I wrote the shared methods in the superclass instead of repeating them in each specific vehicle class.Then, for each specific vehicle, I created a subclass that only holds the unique details like the name and MPG, while inheriting the shared behavior from the superclass. Futhermore, I applied the similar logic to the file Ales to find the alcohol content in specifc types of alcohol and provide a description by utlizing superclass.
 
    Comparing my code to the professor’s, I can see that I’ve improved and also noticed a few small refinements I can make in the future.One thing I feel I did well was giving detailed comments throughout my code to explain what is occurring. Furthermore, I tested my code with real numbers not only to verify that it was working correctly but also to see the different outcomes from various inputs.However, I noticed that naming the superclass "supervehicles" or "superales" instead of just "vehicles" or "ales" could have been more beneficial. This would help the viewer easily identify that the class is a superclass without relying solely on comments.Additionally, another improvement I need to make is including more docstrings. While I have improved my comments to explain what specific code does, I have not utilized docstrings enough to explain the overall purpose of the functions.
